# EC-2023-Junior-Competition
The Junior Design team may include two (2) to four (4) members. You are tasked to develop and prototype a helmet that can survive 40 lbs of force from a falling object. This will be tested on a Styrofoam head model. THE HELMET MUST NOT EXCEED 1.5 lbs.

Materials:
Cardboard, styrofoam, chopsticks, string, duct tape, glue, utility knife

Goal:
Protect the styrofoam head model by designing a safety helmet, while using
minimal materials as possible.

This was a project for fun and enjoyment - something other than academic studying with friends :)
